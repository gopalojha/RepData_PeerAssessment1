# Loading and preprocessing the data

## load the csv in data frame 
df <- read.csv('activity.csv', as.is=TRUE)

## generate df2 with complete cases only 
df2 <- na.omit(df)

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

## aggregate steps as per date to get total number of steps in a day
table_date_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, df2, sum)

## create histogram of total number of steps in a day
hist(table_date_steps$steps, col=1, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab="Total number of steps in a day")

## get mean and median total number of steps per day
mean(table_date_steps$steps)

## [1] 10766.19

median(table_date_steps$steps)

## [1] 10765

## The mean and median total number of steps per day are 10766 and 10765 steps respectively.

# What is the average daily activity pattern?

## aggregate steps as interval to get average number of steps in an interval across all days
table_interval_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, df2, mean)

## generate the line plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
plot(table_interval_steps$interval, table_interval_steps$steps, type='l', col=1, main="Average number of steps averaged over all days", xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps")

## find row id of maximum average number of steps in an interval
max_ave_steps_row_id <- which.max(table_interval_steps$steps)

## get the interval with maximum average number of steps in an interval
table_interval_steps [max_ave_steps_row_id, ]

## interval    steps
## 104       835      206.2
## The interval 835 has the maximum average number of steps (206.2).

# Imputing missing values

## get rows with NA's
df_NA <- df[!complete.cases(df),]

## number of rows
nrow(df_NA)

## [1] 2304

## The total number of rows with NA's is 2304 as shown above.

## perform the imputation
for (i in 1:nrow(df)){
  if (is.na(df$steps[i])){
    interval_val <- df$interval[i]
    row_id <- which(table_interval_steps$interval == interval_val)
    steps_val <- table_interval_steps$steps[row_id]
    df$steps[i] <- steps_val
  }
}

## aggregate steps as per date to get total number of steps in a day
table_date_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, df, sum)

## create histogram of total number of steps in a day
hist(table_date_steps_imputed$steps, col=1, main="(Imputed) Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab="Total number of steps in a day")

## get mean and median of total number of steps per day
mean(table_date_steps_imputed$steps)

## [1] 10766

median(table_date_steps_imputed$steps)

## [1] 10766

## get mean and median of total number of steps per day for data with NA's removed
mean(table_date_steps$steps)

## [1] 10766

median(table_date_steps$steps)

## [1] 10765

## Due to data imputation, the means remain same whereas there is slight change in median value.

# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

## convert date from string to Date class
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

## add a new column indicating day of the week 
df$day <- weekdays(df$date)

## add a new column called day type and initialize to weekday
df$day_type <- c("weekday")

## If day is Saturday or Sunday, make day_type as weekend
for (i in 1:nrow(df)){
  if (df$day[i] == "Saturday" || df$day[i] == "Sunday"){
    df$day_type[i] <- "weekend"
  }
}

## convert day_time from character to factor
df$day_type <- as.factor(df$day_type)

## aggregate steps as interval to get average number of steps in an interval across all days
table_interval_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ interval+day_type, df, mean)

## make the panel plot for weekdays and weekends
library(ggplot2)
qplot(interval, steps, data=table_interval_steps_imputed, geom=c("line"), xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of steps", main="") + facet_wrap(~ day_type, ncol=1)
